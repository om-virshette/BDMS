Key Features of a Blood Donation Management System

User Registration and Management: The system allows users to register as blood donors by providing personal and medical information. Donors can update their details and view their donation history, ensuring that their information is current and accurate. 

Emergency Notifications: In urgent situations, the system can send notifications to potential donors with the required blood type, mobilizing the community quickly to meet critical needs. 

Blood Donation Camps Management: The platform can organize and manage blood donation camps, making it easier for donors to find opportunities to contribute to their communities. 

Inventory Management: Blood banks can manage their inventory of blood products, including tracking expiry dates and alerting staff when supplies are low. This helps reduce wastage and ensures that blood products are available when needed. 

User-Friendly Interface: The system is designed to be intuitive, allowing both donors and blood bank staff to navigate easily and manage the donation process electronically.
